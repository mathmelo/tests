# Code Coverage and E2E Tests

> **End-to-end testing applicability and code coverage metrics.**

Observations
- In some cases, it is not possible to test the entire aplication with unit tests, so using e2e tests is a good pratice to maintain the code.

Technologies
- mocha (assert lib)
- nyc *instanbul* (code coverage lib)
- supertest (http test lib)
